# Netflix Project Backend 

This project aims to provide the backend services for a Netflix-like platform, allowing users to browse and watch content, manage profiles, and integrate with a shopping service. The backend is built using Node.js with Express, utilizing JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, Joi for validation, and Nodemailer for email notifications. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and key details.

## State Management

Redux is used to manage the global state of the application, including user authentication, screen management, and content browsing.

- Auth Slice: Manages user login, signup, and authentication state
- User Slice: Manages user profile and screen limit state
- Content Slice: Manages movie and TV show data
- Shop Slice Manages products and categories

## Screen Limit

Each user is limited to a maximum of 5 screens. This is managed in the User Slice of the Redux store. If a user tries to add more than 5 screens, they will be notified and prevented from doing so.
